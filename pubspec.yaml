# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer

    - assets/images/day22/icons/
    - assets/images/day22/photos/
    - assets/images/day22/users/
    - assets/images/day23/
    - assets/images/day24/
    - assets/images/day29/
    - assets/images/day30/
    - assets/screenshot/day21/1.png
    - assets/screenshot/day22/1.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Nunito
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito-Black.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nunito-Regular.ttf
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
